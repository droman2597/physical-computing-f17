List of Artists:
1)TVBGone-
I like this particular project because it would be fun to prank
many indiviudals with it. For example, if someone was watching 
a sports game and a big play was made, you can turn it off.


2)EyeWriter-
I definitely think this would be an ideal project for disabled people that either want to be artists or just want to draw 
for entertainment purposes.


3)What You See is What You Get-
This project is intresting because it gives a better sense of what you are witnessing as you walk around places like Times Square
It would help you get more out of just seeing these ads and lights.
